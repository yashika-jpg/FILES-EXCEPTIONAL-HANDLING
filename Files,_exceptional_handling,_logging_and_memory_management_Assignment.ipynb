        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "- Compiled and interpreted languages are two fundamental types of programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        " >Compiled language - It is a programming language that is generally compiled and not interpret.It is one where the program, once compiled is expressed in the instructions of the target machine this machine code is undecipherable by humans. Types of compiled language - C, C++ etc.\n",
        "\n",
        " >Interpreted language - It is a programming language that is generally interpreted, without compile a program into machine instructions. It is the one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead, read and executed by some other program. Types of Interpreted language - Python , JavaScript etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling in Python refers to managing runtime errors that may occur during the execution of a program.Instead of letting your program crash, you can “catch” these errors and take appropriate actions\n",
        "\n",
        " In Python, exceptions are raised when errors or unexpected situations arise during program execution, such as division by zero, trying to access a file that does not exist, or attempting to perform an operation on incompatible data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The `finally` block is a crucial component of exception handling in programming languages such as Python , java. Its primary purpose is to ensure that certain cleanup code runs regardless of whether an exception is thrown, providing a unified way to handle resource management, like closing files or releasing memory, after an operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- The logging module in Python provides various functions and classes to configure logging effectively, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Loggers: Responsible for creating log entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Handlers: Send log records (created by loggers) to the appropriate destination.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Formatters: Specify the format of log records.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Filters: Add filtering functionality to handlers and loggers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- How Python Logging Works?\n",
        "Python logging works by creating loggers that generate log messages, handlers that send these messages to designated destinations, formatters that define the structure of the log messages, and filters that control which log records are output. When a logger records a message, it passes through the filters and is sent to the handlers, where it is formatted and finally output to the configured destination such as a file.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the _ _del_ _ method in Python?\n",
        "- The _ _del_ _ method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows you to define specific cleanup actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "  It allows you to define specific actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected, such as closing files, releasing locks, or closing network connections.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  This method can enhance the robustness and reliability of your applications by preventing resource leaks and ensuring that resources are properly released.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python ?\n",
        "- The difference between import and from import in Python is:\n",
        "\n",
        "    \"import\" imports an entire code library. we use \"import\" when we want to use multiple members of the module.\n",
        "\n",
        "    \"from...import\" imports a specific member or members of the library. Using from...import can save you from repeating the module name when you need to use its code many times in your code project.\n",
        "    we use \"from...import\" when we want to save ourself from typing the module name over and over again.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, you can catch different types of exceptions and handle each one appropriately.\n",

        "print(divide_numbers(10, 2))\n",
        "    # Output: 5\n",
        "print(divide_numbers(10, 0))\n",
        "    # Output: Error: Division by zero! None\n",
        "print(divide_numbers(10.5, 2))\n",
        "    # Output: 5   \n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python ?\n",
        "- The with statement is used to simplify and enhance the process of working with files (or other resources) by ensuring proper resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Its primary purpose is to handle the opening and closing of files automatically, even if an error occurs during file operations.  \n",
        "   \n",
        "    purposes:\n",
        "    1. Automatic Resource Management  \n",

        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "- The most significant difference between multiprocessing and multithreading is that multiprocessing executes many processes at the same time, whereas multithreading executes many threads of a process at the same time.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Multiprocessing and multithreading are two techniques used to improve the performance and efficiency of a system by executing multiple tasks concurrently. However, they achieve this in different ways and are suitable for different types of tasks.\n",
        "  \n",
        " > Multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing involves using multiple CPUs to run multiple processes simultaneously.\n",

        "\n",
        "  Python’s memory management, a pro being memory-efficient code, helps contribute to its widespread use. However, some minor challenges exist as well. Here’s a look at the pros and cons.\n",
        "\n",
        "   > Pros:\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. Code written in Python is efficient with its memory use, allowing you to minimize the demand on other system resources and increase processing speeds.\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. Python generators effectively handle memory for large data sets by creating data streams that prevent you from saving the whole data set in the memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3. Over-allocating memory leads to memory leaks, which cause programs to operate slower, but garbage collection helps prevent this.\n",
        "\n",
        "    > Cons:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Python memory management doesn’t offer the same level of manual customizability compared to other programming languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Program runtimes can potentially experience slower rates as sometimes the program holds freed memory in the interpreter rather than freeing it up for use by the operating system.\n",

        " 3. Optimizing Data Structures\n",
        "\n",
        " > Python's high-level abstractions (lists, dicts, objects) are convenient but can be memory-hungry. Efficient memory management helps you:\n",

        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "- Python has built-in exceptions which can output an error. If an error occurs while running the program, it’s called an exception.\n",
        "  If an exception occurs, the type of exception is shown.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The idea of the try-except block is this:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Try: The \"try\" block is used to enclose code that might raise an exception. When an exception occurs within the try block, control is immediately transferred to the corresponding \"except\" block (if any).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Except: This code is only executed if an exception occured in the try block. The except block is required with a try block, even if it contains only the pass statement.\n",

        "\n",
        " 2.Improved readability: It makes the flow of logic clearer—what happens when things go wrong (except), what happens when they go right (else), and what always happens (finally).\n",
        "\n",
        " 3.Avoids masking errors: By placing non-risky code in the else block, you prevent it from being accidentally caught by the except clause.\n",
